# TDD and unit testing
This lecture is about unit testing and TDD in python
One does TDD for many reasons, including:
- Knowing when the project is done
- Goal keeping
- Maintainability
- Reducung technical debt
- Being able to work in group
- Because it is what is expected in the industry
- And its fun

## What tests should I write?
Your tests are directly linked with your product specifications. In an agile 
environment, the Product Owner and Scrum Master will come up with project Specs.
Your tests will mirror these specs

### Example Specs
These are the specs your Product Owner and Scrum Master have come up with 
during their meetings:
- There should be a Calculator object
- It should add 2 numbers
- It should subtract 2 numbers
- It should also multiply and divide 2 numbers
- Nice to have: it could keep the last result in memory
